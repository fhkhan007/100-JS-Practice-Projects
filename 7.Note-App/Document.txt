14) Exercises for you (do one at a time)

Add a CSS rule for .note (height, width, margin) and see how the UI changes.

Change id generation to Date.now() and test adding many notes quickly.

Replace filter(...)[0] with find(...) and add a guard if (!target) return;.

Try using element.dataset.id = id inside createNoteEl and read it in the delete handler (shows dataset usage).

Implement a small “Are you sure you want to leave?” beforeunload test (optional).

15) Want me to continue?

I can:

a) Show a small refactor that groups helper functions and cleans code (one patch at a time),

b) Add CSS + make the UI look nicer,

c) Add debounced saving (so it doesn’t write on every keystroke), or

d) Turn this into a tiny React version.

Tell me which one you want next and I’ll do that step-by-step. (If you want, I can start with the CSS or the find() refactor right away.)
